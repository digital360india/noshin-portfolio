          After transitioning from a background in physiotherapy, I&apos;ve
          dedicated myself to helping young learners navigate the competitive
          entrance processes for renowned institutions like Welham Girls&apos;
          School, Mayo College, Scindia Kanya Vidyalaya, The Doon School, and
          others. My goal is to guide students toward academic success while
          fostering their personal growth, helping them stand out in competitive
          entrance exams, interviews, and overall school applications.
